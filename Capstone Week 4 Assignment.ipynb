    "John Smith is a 37 year old IT Professional living in the neighbourhood of St. James Town in Toronto, Canada. John has a particular affinity to his current neighbourhood because of the eclectic mix of restaurants, bars, cafes and other venues in his immediate vicinity. For personal reasons however, John is required to relocate to Manhattan, New York. He is therefore seeking a shortlist of suitable neighbourhoods in Manhattan to which to relocate which are similar to St. James Town in terms of the local mix of venues. "

    "To provide a suitable recommendation to John Smith on the neighbourhoods in Manhattan which are similar to St. James Town, all neighbourhoods in both Toronto and Manhattan will be clustered using k-means clustering. The clustering will be based on the composition of the top 10 venues within a 500m radius of the geographic center of each neighbourhood. Those neighbourhoods in Manhattan which are also in the same cluster as St. James Town will then comprise the shortlist of neighbourhoods that John should consider relocating to. \n",

    "The FourSquare.com database has been queried previously and the top 10 venues within 500m of each neighbourhood in Manhattan have been identified. The latitude and longitude of each venue and each neighbourhood have been identified (see Coursera Capstone Project Week 3). Similarly, the top 10 venues within 500m of each neighbourhood of Toronto have been identified in the Capstone Project Week 3 Student Assignment.
